<p>I’m an Australian born in Perth where I am currently living now. I have also lived for about 10 years in Thailand and travelled around many Asian countries including China, Hong Kong, Myanmar, Laos, Singapore, Malaysia and Cambodia. After graduating high school, I studied Instructional Multimedia at TAFE that I obtained a Diploma in 1997. I also have a Cambridge CELTA certificate from Edith Cowan University certifying that I have been trained to deliver English language training to Adults. While living in Thailand I sometimes worked as an English teacher and was able to learn how to speak and write in Thai language which I still use on a daily basis now. I am currently learning Indonesian. I spent a lot of time riding around on a scooter in Thailand without a major accident, a few near misses and a few minor dings. I obtained by motorcycle license in Australia a few years ago and purchased a Honda Shadow 600VTC cruiser which is a pleasure to ride, during the summer.</p>

<p>My main hobby at the moment is learning to play the piano and produce music. I have two keyboards a Necktor Impact GX49 MIDI controller and a KORG microKey 2 MIDI controller. I like MIDI controllers because their sound is only limited by the software that I have and can be changed or updated. I also like that I able to record and manipulate music very easily. I am able to plug both of them into my laptop or iPad Pro and user a number of programs to learn and record music. I have the KORG as I can put it into a backpack, and it is easy to travel with. I can read music and know the keys on the keyboard and consider myself an advanced beginner. When I play the piano It really makes me feel a sense of accomplishment when I can successfully play a song and calm as I am playing.</p>

<header><h1>Interest in IT</h1></header>

<p>My interest in IT started when I was a child. My father purchased a Celecovision games console, then a Commodore C64 computer and Finally a Commodore Amiga 500 for me to use. At the start I just used the computers for games. I programmed little programs on the C64 but I got AMOS, a integrated development environment, on the Amiga and used to program little instructional games to help me with my high school classes. Since then I have always loved to program computers, games and now digital music and art. Since the mid-1990s I have owned a series of Apple computers and a number of Windows and Linux PCs that I built myself. Since finishing my Diploma, I have been creating and maintaining websites as well as offering IT support services, sometimes working contract at government departments and for a while freelance. I don’t think I have spent a day where I didn’t interact with a computer since I was 20 years old.</p>

<p>I chose to study at RMIT because I wanted to increase my skills. I would like to move into a new role and feel I need a qualification to do it. RMIT is a university that has very good reputation as a high-quality university. I wanted to have the best and most rigorous study so that I will learn and be able to offer my clients and employers in the future the best possible level of service. I expect to learn a comprehensive and in-depth knowledge of Information Technology and its many disciplines. I would also like to do a minor in Business so that I can not only offer a high level of knowledge in Information Technology, but I can also offer it with a sound business acumen. I believe after working at multiple companies over a few decades I have a lot of knowledge already but believe that with my studies I will be able to fill in any gaps that I have in my knowledge and experience. This will allow me to take my career to the next level. One thing that I am most interested in is how people interact with technology which is something that is part of every one of the subjects as we are almost always interacting with digital machines these days.</p>
