<p>Iâ€™m an Australian born in Perth where I am currently living now. I have also lived for about 10 years in Thailand and travelled around many Asian countries including China, Hong Kong, Myanmar, Laos, Singapore, Malaysia and Cambodia. After graduating high school, I studied Instructional Multimedia at TAFE that I obtained a Diploma in 1997. I also have a Cambridge CELTA certificate from Edith Cowan University certifying that I have been trained to deliver English language training to Adults. While living in Thailand I sometimes worked as an English teacher and was able to learn how to speak and write in Thai language which I still use on a daily basis now. I am currently learning Indonesian. I spent a lot of time riding around on a scooter in Thailand without a major accident, a few near misses and a few minor dings. I obtained by motorcycle license in Australia a few years ago and purchased a Honda Shadow 600VTC cruiser which is a pleasure to ride, during the summer.</p>

<p>My main hobby at the moment is learning to play the piano and produce music. I have two keyboards a Necktor Impact GX49 MIDI controller and a KORG microKey 2 MIDI controller. I like MIDI controllers because their sound is only limited by the software that I have and can be changed or updated. I also like that I able to record and manipulate music very easily. I am able to plug both of them into my laptop or iPad Pro and user a number of programs to learn and record music. I have the KORG as I can put it into a backpack, and it is easy to travel with. I can read music and know the keys on the keyboard and consider myself an advanced beginner. When I play the piano It really makes me feel a sense of accomplishment when I can successfully play a song and calm as I am playing.</p>p>
