<p>I&rsquo;m an Australian born in Perth where I am currently living now. I have also lived for about 10 years in Thailand and travelled around many Asian countries including China, Hong Kong, Myanmar, Laos, Singapore, Malaysia and Cambodia. After graduating high school, I studied Instructional Multimedia at TAFE that I obtained a Diploma in 1997. I also have a Cambridge CELTA certificate from Edith Cowan University certifying that I have been trained to deliver English language training to Adults. While living in Thailand I sometimes worked as an English teacher and was able to learn how to speak and write in Thai language which I still use on a daily basis now. I am currently learning Indonesian. I spent a lot of time riding around on a scooter in Thailand without a major accident, a few near misses and a few minor dings. I obtained by motorcycle license in Australia a few years ago and purchased a Honda Shadow 600VTC cruiser which is a pleasure to ride, during the summer.</p>

<p>My main hobby at the moment is learning to play the piano and produce music. I have two keyboards a Necktor Impact GX49 MIDI controller and a KORG microKey 2 MIDI controller. I like MIDI controllers because their sound is only limited by the software that I have and can be changed or updated. I also like that I able to record and manipulate music very easily. I am able to plug both of them into my laptop or iPad Pro and user a number of programs to learn and record music. I have the KORG as I can put it into a backpack, and it is easy to travel with. I can read music and know the keys on the keyboard and consider myself an advanced beginner. When I play the piano It really makes me feel a sense of accomplishment when I can successfully play a song and calm as I am playing.</p>

      <header><h1>Interest in IT</h1></header>
      <div class="content-container">

<p>My interest in IT started when I was a child. My father purchased a Celecovision games console, then a Commodore C64 computer and Finally a Commodore Amiga 500 for me to use. At the start I just used the computers for games. I programmed little programs on the C64 but I got AMOS, a integrated development environment, on the Amiga and used to program little instructional games to help me with my high school classes. Since then I have always loved to program computers, games and now digital music and art. Since the mid-1990s I have owned a series of Apple computers and a number of Windows and Linux PCs that I built myself. Since finishing my Diploma, I have been creating and maintaining websites as well as offering IT support services, sometimes working contract at government departments and for a while freelance. I don&rsquo;t think I have spent a day where I didn&rsquo;t interact with a computer since I was 20 years old.</p>

<p>I chose to study at RMIT because I wanted to increase my skills. I would like to move into a new role and feel I need a qualification to do it. RMIT is a university that has very good reputation as a high-quality university. I wanted to have the best and most rigorous study so that I will learn and be able to offer my clients and employers in the future the best possible level of service. I expect to learn a comprehensive and in-depth knowledge of Information Technology and its many disciplines. I would also like to do a minor in Business so that I can not only offer a high level of knowledge in Information Technology, but I can also offer it with a sound business acumen. I believe after working at multiple companies over a few decades I have a lot of knowledge already but believe that with my studies I will be able to fill in any gaps that I have in my knowledge and experience. This will allow me to take my career to the next level. One thing that I am most interested in is how people interact with technology which is something that is part of every one of the subjects as we are almost always interacting with digital machines these days.</p>

<p>Why it&rsquo;s attractive, skills, qualifications, experience and how that relates to mine. Plan to achieve this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39238920" target="_blank">https://www.seek.com.au/job/39238920</a></p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to work in a user experience (UX) role such as the one advertised on Seek see attachment and link. It is a role that someone will be working to help the company making products that the company makes as easy and intuitive to use as possible. It includes doing user behaviour research, user testing, finding the best way to present information, designing interfaces and the way users interact with the products. This means working making sure that the business goals of the company are met while the end user has the best experience. This role will require working with a team of people as well as people across the organisation.
There are many skills involved with this role. There are soft skills like being a good communicator and working with other people both in a team and outside. Problem-solving skills will also be a must. Working under time pressure will mean that one must work well under stress. There is a knowledge of software products like Adobe software, Invision and Sketch along with all the normal office software. Most importantly one would have to have a high level of understanding of user cantered design and the various disciplines that it encompasses including user research, journey mapping, usability testing, information architecture, user interface and interaction design. This role will also require one to continue to learn and keep up to date with the latest trends in the industry.</p>

<p>The skills that I currently have actually already fit well into this industry. I have been a web designer and developer for years and have knowledge of the software required. I&rsquo;m also a frequent user tester, having been involved will about a hundred tests so far. I can make prototypes and wireframes of designs. Over the last few years I have been interest in this field and have already done a lot of reading about it. I&rsquo;m currently doing the RMIT User Cantered Design course which will give me a good overview of many of the other skills needed. I also like to work in teams and communicate and have a proven record of solving in my personal life and work.</p>

<p>I will need to learn much more about User Cantered Design, Human Computer Interaction, and the practice of research into user testing. I will be doing this over the Information Technology degree, but I will also seek out study with other industry groups. I will have to learn a lot more about how to research and organise information architecture.</p>

<p>Three test results, interpretation of them, how that will affect my behaviour I did the Myers-Briggs test on 16Personalities as well as a learning style test at Education Planner and a creativity test at MindTools. With the following results:</p>

<ul class="personalitytest-list">
<li>Myers-Briggs:
<ul><li>Type: Turbulent Mediator</li>
<li>Code: INFP-T</li>
<li>Role: Diplomat</li>
<li>Strategy: Constant Improvement</li></ul></li>
<li>Learning Style:
<ul><li>Visual learner</li></ul></li>
<li>Creativity:
<ul><li>My creativity is a &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo;. I have had some success but need to push myself in order be more creative.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The Myers-Briggs personality test being the most important test to look at, I will discuss that first. The outcome seems very close to how I see myself. I&rsquo;m a little shy but as I get older it seems this is less of a problem. A creative, deep thinking, perfectionist with a need to communicate. Someone that is dedicated and works hard on something that I believe in. However, I can be idealistic, impractical and sensitive to stress. My personality type is looking for constant improvement. I&rsquo;m flexible and good at improvising always looking for new opportunities.</p>

<p>Being a Diplomat means that I promote cooperation and harmony. I&rsquo;m sympathetic towards other people and can understand the inner motivations intuitively. However, if I feel I have the moral high ground I may be overbearing due to my self-righteousness.</p>

<p>Being a visual learning style means that I need to be shown things rather than just told. I will write things down and usually with different colours and pictures. That I learn things with flashcards. I&rsquo;m attracted to stories with rich imagery. However, I can be easily distracted by sounds and can have difficulty with spoken instructions.</p>

<p>The creativity test really just confirmed that I am what the Myer-Briggs test had already confirmed. That I am creative but there is probably a bit of lack of self-belief I bias the test away from the creativity.</p>

<p>These result means that given the right environment I will be an asset to any team. I will be able to generally get along with everyone on the team and work with people. Work help heal conflict between team members. Constant communication and keeping everyone informed with what is going to happen. I will need to be kept on track as sometimes my perfectionism will lead get stuck on details. I can come up with lots of creative ideas and insights that will solve problems.</p>

<p>I will need to have a team that is willing to communicate and be honest and forthright. That we will all be working together in an environment that fosters creativity and learning from mistakes, no need to fear failure. I work better with smaller teams. I will need to set deadlines and have a little supervision in order to make sure those time goals are met.</p>
